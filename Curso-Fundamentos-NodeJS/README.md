## Introduction to NodeJS
### Event Loop
- **Event Queue:** Contains all the generated events in ours code (Functions, requests, etc), this events stays in an queue and passing one by one in the *Event Loop*.
- **Event Loop:** Resolves ultras fast events coming from the *Event Queue*. In case it cannot be resolved quickly, it sends the event to the *Thread Pool*
- **Thread Pool:** Manages events asynchronously, once finished, it returns it to the *Event Loop*. The *Event Loop* decides if it is passed to the *Event Queue* or not.

### Single Thread
Is necessary treat the errors, one error can crash all the code (disadvantage of Single Threading code execution). [Example](./concepts/singleThread.js)

</div>

## Modules
### Globals
NodeJS has the Object **global**, this Object contains all the basic methods and properties that we use in Node.
*global* is aka for *this*.
```JS
(this === global) // true
```

Some methods used by *global* are:
- *setTimeOut():* calls one function given at time.
- *setInterval():* calls one function every time interval.
- *setImmediate():* same as *setTimeOut()* but time equals 0.
- *clearTimeOut():* stops a *setTimeOut()*.
- *clearInterval():* stops a *setInterval()*.

### Child Process
Has two functions:
- **spawn:** returns a stream:
	- Is used to return big binary data to Node.
	- Is used to receive data since since process begins.
- **exec:** returns a buffer:
	- Is used to return simple state messages.
	- Is used to receive data at the end of the process.
